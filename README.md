Motto: Feeling thirsty? Drink some culture!

Summary of Idea
People are stressed throughout a busy work week and want to relax! We would like to help! Our app allows people to learn about new alcohol beverages. People like to learn stuff and enjoy alcohol as a luxury. Our mission was to create an app to help people have a more meaningful experience with the beverage(s) they like as well as discover new ones! Share new drinks and knowledge with your friends and introduce them to new ones as well. Redefining the phrase ’thirsty for knowledge’. Also, if you're up for a laugh, we also added some dad jokes for you to enjoy.
