## Motivation

Motto: Feeling thirsty? Drink some culture! 

People are stressed throughout a busy work week and want to relax, our app allows people to learn about new alcohol beverages and see local places that sell them. People like to learn stuff and enjoy alcohol as a luxury. Our mission is to create an app to help people have a more meaningful experience with the beverage(s) they like as well as discover new ones! Sharing new drinks and knowledge with your friends and introducing them to new ones as well. Redefining the phrase of being ’thirsty for knowledge’. Benefit local shops/market

“Satisfying thirst for knowledge as well as alcohol”
